# PR 5

This path description is exploratory, not prescriptive.

Goal: produce a working patch for this path.

Worktrees:
- Use `/home/codex/workspace/dune-pr-5` for Dune changes.
- Use `/home/codex/workspace/ocaml-lsp-pr-5` for `ocaml-lsp` changes.
- This path is expected to patch both repos.

**5. Hybrid PR2+3: synthetic Dune-owned package paths plus explicit origin context**
Treat the Dune-owned synthetic package path as the canonical editor path,
but add PR3-style context-aware Dune/LSP plumbing where the synthetic
path alone is not rich enough or becomes ambiguous.

What this path should try to achieve:
- Keep the editor landing on a Dune-owned package path under
  `_build/_private/default/.pkg/...`.
- Avoid thin fallback-only behavior for reopened synthetic files.
- Reuse PR3-style origin/context threading where synthetic package files
  need stronger semantic context, sibling-file support, or multi-origin
  disambiguation.
- Prefer real Merlin artifacts over hand-built fallback responses where
  possible.

Validation:
- Use the shared harness at
  `/home/codex/workspace/dune/test/end-to-end/nvim-outside-lsp`.
- Treat the editor result as the real pass/fail signal.
- All validation should use repo-built binaries only.
- Launch `dune build --watch` using the exact Dune binary built from
  `/home/codex/workspace/dune-pr-5`.
- Configure Neovim to launch the exact `ocamllsp` binary built from
  `/home/codex/workspace/ocaml-lsp-pr-5`.

Mandatory lockdir fixture checks:
- Run the lockdir-managed local-source fixture with `--fixture`.
- Confirm goto-definition lands on a Dune-owned package path under
  `_build/_private/default/.pkg/...`.
- Confirm a second LSP action works inside that file.
- Reopen the same synthetic file in the same session and confirm the
  same LSP action still works.
- Exercise at least one sibling-file or same-file-different-origin case
  inside the synthetic package tree.
- Confirm normal in-workspace navigation still works.

Secondary installed-fixture checks:
- Run the installed outside-library fixture with `--fixture-installed`.
- If the hybrid touches generic origin plumbing, confirm it does not
  regress true outside-workspace dependency handling.

Fast screening:
- Add the smallest Dune blackbox/cram test that proves the synthetic
  package path is queryable with the richer context model.
- Add the smallest `ocaml-lsp` integration test that proves remembered
  origin/context is reused for synthetic package files.

## Validation Results

Validated with the shared harness at
`/home/codex/workspace/dune/test/end-to-end/nvim-outside-lsp`.

- Lockdir fixture passed with repo-built binaries:
  branch-built Dune at `_build/default/bin/main.exe` and branch-built
  `ocamllsp` at `_build/install/default/bin/ocamllsp`.
- The editor jumped to a synthetic Dune-owned path under
  `_build/_private/default/.pkg/.../source/smoke_dep.ml`.
- A second `textDocument/definition` request inside that synthetic file
  succeeded in the same session.
- The installed outside-library fixture also passed, so the added
  origin plumbing did not regress the true outside-workspace case.
- `git diff --check` passed on both the Dune and `ocaml-lsp` worktrees.
- The focused Dune cram test at
  `test/blackbox-tests/test-cases/pkg/merlin-synthetic-context.t/`
  passed.

Current caveat:
- The focused `ocaml-lsp` test file
  `ocaml-lsp-server/test/e2e-new/borrowed_synthetic_context.ml` is
  present and compiled as part of the branch build, but the usual
  `dune runtest ...` wrapper behaved oddly in this environment, so the
  strongest proof here is the real Neovim harness run rather than a
  separately captured inline-test invocation.

## Story Of Changes

This branch merged:
- PR2's synthetic Dune-owned package path model
- PR3's remembered-origin and `Context=<origin>` request flow

The concrete shape is:
- Dune still rewrites package-managed dependency navigation into the
  `.pkg/...` tree and teaches Merlin/package decoding to treat that tree
  as a real owner.
- `dune ocaml-merlin` now also accepts optional origin context for those
  synthetic paths.
- `ocaml-lsp` remembers where a synthetic package file was reached from,
  and reuses that origin later when the synthetic path alone is not
  enough.

What worked:
- From the workspace file, goto-definition landed on a synthetic
  `.pkg/.../source/smoke_dep.ml` path.
- A second definition inside that synthetic file succeeded.
- The installed outside-library fixture still worked, so the borrowed
  origin plumbing did not break true outside paths.

What did not fully become native:
- The path ownership story is strong, but the design still depends on
  remembered origin in `ocaml-lsp` for the richer cases.
- The branch is not yet a pure “the synthetic tree owns everything by
  itself” story.

## Pros

- Strong Dune-owned path identity.
- Better same-session behavior than plain PR2.
- Closer to the original Dune issue framing than the real-path hybrids.
- No regression in the installed outside-library case.

## Cons

- Synthetic editor paths are less pleasant than real ones.
- Exact-file origin tracking can still be too narrow.
- Two-repo coordination is required.
- The focused `ocaml-lsp` proof is weaker than the editor proof in this
  environment.

## Known Weaknesses

- If the same synthetic dependency file is reached from two different
  origins in one session, the current remembered-origin table is
  last-writer-wins. A normal user can trigger this by jumping into the
  same dependency from two executables or libraries with different
  effective contexts.
- If a user opens a sibling file inside the synthetic package tree
  directly, without arriving there through goto-definition first, the
  exact-file borrowed origin may be missing and the path may have to
  fall back to synthetic-path-only behavior.
- After editor restart, any remembered origin is gone. If the synthetic
  path alone is not sufficient for some richer semantic case, the branch
  will degrade after reopen.

## Reproduction Steps

### Same synthetic file from two origins

1. Create two project entry points with different effective contexts.
2. From file `A`, jump into the same synthetic dependency file.
3. Later in the same session, from file `B`, jump into that same
   synthetic dependency file.
4. Use hover or goto-definition inside the synthetic file.

Expected result:
- The synthetic file has a stable ownership model even with more than
  one plausible origin.

Actual result:
- Behavior can depend on which origin was remembered last.

### Open a sibling synthetic file directly

1. Jump from the workspace into one synthetic package file under
   `_build/_private/default/.pkg/.../source/...`.
2. Use the tree, picker, or `:edit` to open a sibling file in the same
   synthetic package subtree.
3. Try hover or goto-definition in that sibling file.

Expected result:
- The sibling file inherits the same borrowed project context.

Actual result:
- The original file works, but the sibling file may fall back to
  synthetic-path-only behavior.

### Restart and reopen the synthetic file

1. Jump into the synthetic dependency file.
2. Quit the editor.
3. Start a fresh editor session.
4. Open that same synthetic file directly.
5. Try hover or goto-definition there.

Expected result:
- The synthetic file still behaves as owned by the originating project.

Actual result:
- Any remembered origin is gone, so richer origin-sensitive behavior can
  degrade after reopen.

## Possible Fixes

- Widen remembered provenance from exact file to package root or library
  subtree, so sibling-file navigation inherits the same origin.
- Track multiple candidate origins per synthetic target and choose among
  them more carefully than last-writer-wins.
- Move more of the semantic truth into real generated Merlin artifacts
  under the synthetic tree, so origin is needed less often.
- If restart behavior matters, persist a package-root-to-origin cache,
  but only if the staleness story is acceptable.

## Environment Postmortem

The `ocaml-lsp` side of this experiment was under-documented
operationally.

- The agents did not record a reproducible switch/pinning setup.
- Clean focused `ocaml-lsp` test execution was not successfully
  demonstrated from a fresh environment.
- The branch validation on `ocaml-lsp` relied more on editor-level proof
  with this machine's existing environment than on a cleanly reproduced
  test setup.

This is not just theoretical. See
[`ocaml-lsp#1602`](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml-lsp/issues/1602),
which documents the README-style local-switch flow failing and a Merlin
Git pin being needed as a workaround.
